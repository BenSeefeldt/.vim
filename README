A place to keep track of all of my vim configuration
files.

In order to use, clone from this repository into home dir
and create link

ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

If this is being run in certain circumstances without
a GUI available(through ssh), there may be some 
problems with CSApprox, which serves to modify the gui
only theme I'm using so that a terminal can use it.
This shouldn't be a problem, it just might lead to some
weird colors.
